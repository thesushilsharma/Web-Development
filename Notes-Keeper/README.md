# To do list
Notes Keeper keeps notes on your browser for as long as you need them. As long as you're using that browser, you can view the notes because they are kept in WEB SQL.

## How It Works
1. Go to [Notes Keeper](https://sushilsharma.info.np/Web-Development/Notes-Keeper/index.html).
2. Add a note.
3. That's it. For as long as you need it, the note is kept in the user's browser.

Anytime you visit [Notes Keeper](https://sushilsharma.info.np/Web-Development/Notes-Keeper/index.html), notes will be displayed.
