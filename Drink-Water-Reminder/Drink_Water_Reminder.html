      <li>Hey, Alert!</li>
      <li>Intoxication of Water.</li>
      <li>This is unusual, but it can occur.</li>
      <li>What happens is that the tissues expand as too much water reaches the cells.</li>
      <li>This induces an imbalance of electrolytes and salts that can cause irregular heartbeats.</li>
      <li>Beat the lungs to allow fluid to penetrate them.</li>
      <li>The pressure caused by swelling would also place pressure on the nerves and brain,</li>
      <li>Which may trigger issues as well.</li>
      <li>Brain swelling can lead to a coma, seizures, and even death.</li>
      <li>For your brain and body to work at best, you need at least 8 oz glasses of water every day.</li>
